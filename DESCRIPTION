Description: Functions for 1) gene filtration; 2) link filtration; 3) differential co-expression analysis: DCG (Differential Coexpressed
        Gene) identification and DCL (Differentially Coexpressed Link)
        identification; and 4) differential regulation analysis: DRG (Differential Regulated
        Gene) identification, DRL (Differential Regulated Link)
        identification, DRL visualization and regulator ranking.
