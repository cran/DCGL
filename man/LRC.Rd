\title{ Identify DCGs (Differential Coexpressed genes) based on 'Log Ratio Connections' }
\description{
  A method to pick out DCGs from microarray data based on 'Log Ratio of Connections' (LRC) (Reverter et al. 2006). 
}
\usage{
LRC(exprs.1, exprs.2, link.method = c("qth", "rth", "percent")[1], cutoff)
}
\arguments{
  \item{exprs.1}{ a data frame or matrix for condition A, with rows as variables (genes) and columns as samples. }
  \item{exprs.2}{ a data frame or matrix for condition B, with rows as variables (genes) and columns as samples. }
  \item{link.method}{ a character string indicating link filtering method, default is 'qth'. }
  \item{cutoff}{ cutoff used for link filtration, can be rth, qth, or percent depending on link.method. must be within [0,1]. }
}
\details{
 'Log Ratio of Connections' (LRC) calculates the logarithm of the ratio of the connectivities of a gene between two conditions (Reverter, et al., 2006). A connectivity of zero is changed to one.
}
\value{
  \item{LRC}{the log Ratio Connections of genes. This measure can be used to rank gene in terms of differential coexpression.}
